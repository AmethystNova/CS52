PROBLEM SET #7 ~~~> GRADER 

NAME: Kimberly Hernandez

COURSE: CS52

DATE: 10/26/16

PURPOSE: Arrays are non-conventional data types in C++, because they are neither classes nor objects. They do not support the dot operator
		and must therefore be accessed in a different, tedious manner. I am to implement a class Grader that stores and analyzes a set of 
		user defined integers.

INPUT: The user is allowed to specify a set of grades (int data types) or a single grade to add to the array. The user can continue to dynamically	
		allocate scores.

OUTPUT: The user can utlize public member functions to prompt for the biggest and smallest scores.
