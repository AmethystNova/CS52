PURPOSE: Linked lists are critical building blocks to many data structures, such as binary trees, doubly linked lists, etc. They are versatile and inexpensive in memory, and allow
		dynamic insertion of data within the structure (unlike arrays that require costly time/resources, though are easier in terms of random access). This program synthesizes the 
		concepts of linked lists (traversing, inserting, appending, deleting, etc) with the concepts of classes. The nodes themselves are classes, and collections of nodes, called LISTS,
		are classes themselves (NOTE --> NOT INHERITANCE!!). I was to implement three additional member functions to the list class (CONCATENATE, REMOVEDUPLICATES, INSERTNTH) that would allow 
		further versatility.
    
INPUT: The user interacts with the main program in order to modify or access the linked list. 

OUTPUT: The modified linked list should be available after the user specifies actions.
