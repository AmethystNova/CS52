PURPOSE: The RecordPlayer class is meant to denote the importance of calling methods in a logical order. Classes are modeled after real-life objects and must therefore behave
		in such way, with unique pre-requisites determining the feasability of specific actions. For example, you cannot turn on what's already on, and if you own a record player,
		you cannot adjust the needle without an album being affixed. 

INPUT: The driver will test the logical fluidity of the class by proposing different actions under different conditions. 

OUTPUT: If the conditions satisfy sound logical order, the class will undergo such actions. If they don't, the class is to output an error message describing the faulty premise.
