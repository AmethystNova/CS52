PURPOSE: To create a wallet class that keeps track of money in dollars and cents, discretely. The user may deposit dollar amounts by visiting an ATM. Additionally, this class allows the user to make purchases depending on the relative values of the cost of desired purchase and the total money in the user's wallet. If the user's money is equal to or exceeds the value of the item at hand, a transaction
should ensue, modifying the dollar/cent amounts in the wallet accordingly. If the item is above the user's means, the transaction should be denied and the money should remain unchanged.
